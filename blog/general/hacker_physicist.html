Security isn&#x27;t &quot;someone else&#x27;s problem&quot; - it&#x27;s part of building quality software.</p><p><strong>For Leaders</strong>: Invest in education and culture. Create environments where people can ask &quot;stupid&quot; questions safely.

After all, whether you&#x27;re calculating the orbit of a satellite or securing an API endpoint, you&#x27;re working with the same fundamental forces that govern our universe.</p><p>The laws of physics don&#x27;t care if you understand them - GPS works because engineers do. Similarly, the laws of information security don&#x27;t care if you understand them - but your applications will be much safer if you do.</p><p>And who knows? You might even find it as beautiful as I find a perfectly crafted function in LISP - elegant, essential, and surprisingly profound.</p><hr/><p>P.S. - Yes, I really did have a vendor suggest AES256-over-HTTP as a &quot;security solution.&quot; No, I&#x27;m not making this up.
